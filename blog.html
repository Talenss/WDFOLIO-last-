                <p class="read-more expanded">My journey into the world of web development began when I attended CMRICTHS, a specialized school focused on computers, covering everything from Microsoft applications to coding and even hardware. It was here that I discovered my love for programmingâ€”especially web development. While I wasnâ€™t the best at designing, I excelled at coding, often bringing my classmates' creative visions to life during group projects.
                    However, my passion for coding faded when the pandemic hit. Without access to a PC or laptop, I was unable to practice, and the excitement I once had for coding slowly disappeared. The long months of isolation drained meâ€”not just academically but also mentally. I felt lost, stuck in a cycle of boredom and uncertainty, with no clear direction in life. It was as if I had become a shadow of my former self, unable to find joy in the things I once loved.
                When the world slowly reopened and face-to-face classes resumed, something inside me reignited. The spark of curiosity and creativity began to return, but it wasnâ€™t the same as before. I realized that the struggles I faced during the pandemic had changed me. The setbacks, the isolation, and the lack of motivation were challenges I had to overcome.
                Now, as I continue on my web development journey, I see those difficult times as a test of resilience. I may not have the same energy as before, but I know that every struggle is an opportunity for growth. The road ahead is uncertain, but I am determined to rebuild my passion, refine my skills, and become stronger than ever</p>

                <p class="read-more expanded">Many people assume that once you have a dream career in mind, every job you take should be aligned with that goal. But life doesnâ€™t always work that way. I chose to work jobs that were <strong>unrelated to my dream career</strong> not because I lost sight of my passion, but because I wanted to <strong>help my parents and support myself</strong>.
                    While these jobs were outside the field I envisioned for my future, they provided me with something equally valuableâ€”<strong>real-world experience</strong>. I wanted to understand what it meant to be part of the workforce, to follow instructions, meet expectations, and navigate both the <strong>positives and challenges</strong> that come with any job. Learning how to <strong>adapt, communicate, and handle pressure</strong> in these roles has been just as important as technical skills in my journey toward my dream job.
                    Another reason I took these jobs was <strong>financial responsibility</strong>. As I grew older, I realized that my needs and wants had increased compared to when I was younger. At the same time, the <strong>cost of living</strong> and household expenses kept rising. I didnâ€™t want my parents to bear that burden alone. Taking on jobs, even outside my preferred field, allowed me to <strong>contribute financially</strong> and gain a deeper appreciation for hard work and financial independence.
                    Looking back, I donâ€™t regret stepping into unfamiliar roles. These experiences <strong>taught me discipline, resilience, and a strong work ethic</strong>â€”qualities that will be just as important in my dream career. Every job, no matter how unrelated, has played a part in shaping who I am today, and for that, I am grateful.</p>
